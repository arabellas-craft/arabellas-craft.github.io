## Working with the Full Moon
During the full moon we have the chance to step back and reflect on all that's been created during this past lunar cycle. It’s important to also take time to pause, reflect, and let go of what you no longer need.

The full moon is a time to embrace gratitude for what you have been given and what you have accomplished. Even if you’re not where you'd like to be, and even if you've had setbacks, you likely still have something you can find gratitude for and something you've done that you can be proud of. Appreciate your own resilience and strength.

The full moon is a time to:
* Express gratitude
* Reflect on what you've accomplished this past lunar cycle
* Reflect on what has been illuminated for you this lunar cycle
* Release what no longer serves you
* Do [your own tarot reading](/free-tarot-spreads/full-moon-tarot-spread) or [get a tarot reading](https://shop.arabellascraft.com/l/MonthAheadTarotReading) for the month ahead

Here are some ideas to try when putting together your own full moon ritual. You can mix and match, add or subtract to any of these. Just think of them as jumping off points for your own intuition and creativity!

## 1. Make a Sacred Space
For me, this is a vital step to get me into the right headspace for ritual. Surround yourself with things that taste, sound, smell, look and feel good to you and help you relax. I have certain incense and music that I only use during my moon rituals, just hearing that music or smelling that incense can instantly get me ready for ritual.

## 2. Ground Yourself
Grounding yourself can be done in lots of different ways, but my favorite is doing a simple [body scan meditation](https://stopbreathethink.com/anxiety/body-scan/) where you feel into each part of your body one after another. Another great grounding technique is the [5-4-3-2-1 technique](https://www.mondaycampaigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/destress-monday-infographic-54321-grounding-technique.png) where you name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

## 3. Journaling Prompts
After grounding myself I generally start my ritual with journaling. Journaling can be a great way to connect with your gratitude, challenges and make peace with what you need to release and let go of. Every full moon I create a sacred space (even if it's just in my house!) and spend some time journaling, with some of the following prompts:

* What am I grateful for right now?
* What has happened in the past month that I feel most grateful for?
* What do I appreciate about my own mind, body, and spirit?
* What tiny miracles show up in my world?
* What do I love most about my life right now?
* What do I love most about myself right now?

* What obstacles and challenges have taught me meaningful life lessons recently?
* What’s one of my favorite memories from the past month? What's one of the hardest?
* How have your relationships changed and grown this past month?
* Was there anything holding me back from reaching my goals this month?
* What did I spend too little or too much time on this month?

* What do you need to surrender to this month?
* I choose to let go of the things I can’t control, including…
* What secrets are you holding onto and what harm are they causing?
* Which relationships in your life no longer serve you?

## 4. Tarot Card Reading
After journaling I like to give myself a tarot reading for the month ahead. You can [see the spread I use]((/free-tarot-spreads/full-moon-tarot-spread)) to try on your own, or [get a reading from me](https://shop.arabellascraft.com/l/MonthAheadTarotReading). Make sure to record your reading and your thoughts in your tarot journal to reference later!

## 5. Release
The last step of my full moon ritual is releasing what I no longer need. As we move towards the waning moon, this is a great time to let go of the old to make room for the new. The simplest version of this ritual is writing what you wish to release on a piece of paper and then burning or burying it. Adding sigils to your paper or burning it with banishing herbs is a great way to enhance this ritual.

## 6. Closing
After releasing I normally like to do something small to close my ritual. This will vary from month to month, but anoint myself with ritual oils, or take a ritual bath to cleanse and recharge myself until the New Moon.

I hope these full moon ritual ideas and journal prompts have given you some ideas for your own full moon ritual. Working with the full moon can be extremely powerful and rewarding! Let your intuition guide you!
