## Working with the Full Moon
During the full moon we have the chance to step back and reflect on all that's been created during this past lunar cycle. It’s important to also take time to pause, reflect, and let go of what you no longer need.

The full moon is a time to embrace gratitude for what you have been given and what you have accomplished. Even if you’re not where you'd like to be, and even if you've had setbacks, you likely still have something you can find gratitude for and something you've done that you can be proud of. Appreciate your own resilience and strength.

The full moon is a time to:
* Express gratitude
* Reflect on what you've accomplished this past lunar cycle
* Reflect on what has been illuminated for you this lunar cycle
* Release what no longer serves you
* Do [your own tarot reading](/free-tarot-spreads/full-moon-tarot-spread) or [get a tarot reading](https://shop.arabellascraft.com/l/MonthAheadTarotReading) for the month ahead

## Journal Prompts
Journaling can be a great way to connect with your gratitude, challenges and make peace with what you need to release and let go of. Every full moon I create a sacred space (even if it's just in my house!) and spend some time journaling, with some of the following prompts:

* What am I grateful for right now?
* What has happened in the past month that I feel most grateful for?
* What do I appreciate about my own mind, body, and spirit?
* What tiny miracles show up in my world?
* What do I love most about my life right now?
* What do I love most about myself right now?

* What obstacles and challenges have taught me meaningful life lessons recently?
* What’s one of my favorite memories from the past month? What's one of the hardest?
* How have your relationships changed and grown this past month?
* Was there anything holding me back from reaching my goals this month?
* What did I spend too little or too much time on this month?

* What do you need to surrender to this month?
* I choose to let go of the things I can’t control, including…
* What secrets are you holding onto and what harm are they causing?
* Which relationships in your life no longer serve you?
