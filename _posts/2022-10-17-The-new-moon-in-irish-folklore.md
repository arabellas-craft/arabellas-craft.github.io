In Irish folk practices the new moon (gealach úr in Irish) is seen as a time for jumpstarting growth, setting intentions, and ensuring your luck until the next new moon. What you do on the night of the new moon sets the tone for that lunar cycle. 

Many of these customs are based off of what you are doing when you first see the new moon so I feel it’s important to note that the Irish counted the dark moon (when no moon is visible in the sky) as it’s own phase, and the new moon would have been when the moon first became visible again.

The sources for these practices are all from [The School’s Collection](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes) and they come from all over Ireland. They were collected by school children in the 1930’s who were tasked with interviewing their parents, grandparents, and neighbors for what folklore they remembered from their childhoods.


## Growth and good luck

- Whatever you are holding when you first see the new moon, you will have more of that by the next new moon <cite>source [1](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4481744/4408474/4481359), [2](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4493731/4415146/4528573</cite>
- Planting at the new moon ensures growth for crops <cite>source [1](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4922008/4917940/4941702), [2](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4922008/4917941/4941713</cite>
- If you have coins in your pocket when you see the new moon, turn them sunwise (east to west) to bring you wealth over the coming month, although in some sources it is enough just to hold or shake them <cite>source [1](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5044631/5027705/5143754), [2](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5008910/4966124/5108346), [3](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5008912/4966261/5106237), [4](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5236081/5229606), [5](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4922361/4874168/5078838</cite>

        - Or just make a wish! <cite>[source](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4769972/4763468/4785562</cite>

There is also tons of weather divination done with the moon in Irish culture. The most common piece of lore about the new moon is that if the new moon appears on it’s back, it means bad weather, or sometimes it means a wet month.

## Traditional prayer upon seeing the new moon

Almost all new moon prayers start with the following stanza

> I see the moon  
And the moon sees me  
God bless the moon  
And God bless me.

and it is sometimes extended with

> Grace in the kitchen, 
Grace in the hall.
May the grace of God,
Be about us all.

or

> There's light in the cottage,  
There's light in the hall.  
And the glory of God,  
Is over us all.
