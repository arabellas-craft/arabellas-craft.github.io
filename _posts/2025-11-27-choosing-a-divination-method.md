Want to start reading cards or tea leaves but don't know where to begin? You don't need expensive tools or special training. A regular deck of cards works. So does a book you already own. This guide breaks down seven divination methods for beginners so you can pick one and actually start.

## 1. Tarot Cards

**What it is:** 78 cards split into Major Arcana (big life lessons) and Minor Arcana (daily situations). Each card has symbolic imagery that tells a story.

**Best for:** Deep dives into complicated situations and big decisions. Works well when you need to understand multiple angles of a problem.

**Time needed:** 15-30 minutes

**Learning curve:** Moderate. You'll learn 78 card meanings, but illustrated decks make this easier because you can read the pictures. The Rider-Waite-Smith deck is designed for visual interpretation.

**Cost to start:** $25-60 for a deck ([Rider-Waite-Smith](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9780913866139) is the beginner standard), or start with an at-home [printable version of the deck](https://ko-fi.com/s/5f1138f832?utm_source=website) for $1.99

**Try it if:** You want serious depth and don't mind studying. Tarot handles complexity better than most methods, and it grows with you as your skill develops.

**Guides available:** [Learn Tarot](https://ko-fi.com/s/8f56e7fcd8?utm_source=website) for 99¢, and [Beyond the Little White Book: A Zine for Tarot Interpretation and Intuitive Reading for Beginners](https://ko-fi.com/s/f24c63dba8?utm_source=website) for 99¢

## 2. Playing Card Divination (Cartomancy)

**What it is:** Regular playing cards for readings. Hearts connect to emotions, diamonds to money and career, clubs to action and goals, spades to challenges and change. Card numbers carry symbolic weight.

**Best for:** Understanding relationships and situations without buying special decks. Good for travel since you can carry cards anywhere.

**Time needed:** 10-20 minutes

**Learning curve:** Moderate. You'll learn 52 cards instead of 78. The structure mirrors tarot but feels more accessible to some people.

**Cost to start:** $0 if you own cards

**Try it if:** You want tarot-style depth but prefer working with familiar objects. Playing card divination has centuries of history behind it.

## 3. Tea Leaf Reading (Tasseography)

**What it is:** Drink loose leaf tea from a light-colored cup, swirl the remaining leaves, flip the cup over, then read the symbols formed by the leaves

**Best for:** Building intuition and symbol-reading skills. The process itself is meditative.

**Time needed:** 15-25 minutes (includes drinking the tea)

**Learning curve:** Moderate to Advanced. Success depends on your ability to spot patterns and trust what you see. Some people take to it naturally; others need more practice.

**Cost to start:** $5-10 for loose tea and a white or light-colored cup with sloping sides

**Try it if:** You trust your gut and like working with symbols. Tea leaf reading rewards patience and gets easier with repetition.

## 4. Dice Divination

**What it is:** Roll three six-sided dice into a circle. Add up the numbers. Look up what that total means. The system comes from Victorian fortune-telling traditions.

**Best for:** Fast answers to specific questions. Works well for yes/no decisions or when you need quick guidance.

**Time needed:** 2-5 minutes

**Learning curve:** Easy. Learn what numbers 3 through 18 mean, roll your dice, read the meaning.

**Cost to start:** $0 if you have dice

**Try it if:** You want quick clarity without memorizing complex symbol systems. Dice divination is straightforward.

## 5. Bibliomancy

**What it is:** Hold your question in mind, open a book to a random page, read the passage. The words provide perspective on your situation. Ancient practice used with sacred texts, poetry, and philosophy.

**Best for:** People who think in words and love books. Works especially well for questions about meaning and direction rather than practical details.

**Time needed:** 5-10 minutes

**Learning curve:** Easy to Moderate. The mechanics are simple—anyone can open a book. Reading passages metaphorically takes more practice.

**Cost to start:** $0—poetry collections, philosophy books, and novels you already own all work

**Try it if:** You're a reader who connects deeply with written words. The best books for bibliomancy have layered meanings you can read multiple ways.

**eBook available:** [Bibliomancy: The Complete Guide](https://ko-fi.com/s/71bb6a9240?utm_source=website) for $1.99

## 6. Charm Casting

**What it is:** Throw small objects (charms, stones, coins) onto a cloth, read where they land

**Best for:** Visual thinkers who like building their own systems

**Time needed:** 10-20 minutes

**Learning curve:** Moderate—you assign meanings to objects and learn position reading

**Cost to start:** $5-15 for small objects (or free if you use what you have)

**Try it if:** You like hands-on work and want to create something uniquely yours.

## 7. Pendulum Reading

**What it is:** Weighted object on a string swings to answer yes/no questions

**Best for:** Simple questions and energy work

**Time needed:** 5-10 minutes

**Learning curve:** Easy—learn swing patterns, ask questions, watch

**Cost to start:** $0-15 (make one from a necklace or buy one)

**Try it if:** You want the simplest method possible.
