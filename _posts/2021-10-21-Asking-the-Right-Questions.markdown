The best way I've found to get the most of a tarot reading is by asking good questions. How can you ask good questions in tarot readings? Here's 4 things that have helped me.

## 1. Ask Open Ended Questions
Try to avoid asking yes or not questions. There are lots of other divination styles that are better suited to yes/no questions (pendulums are great for this). Allow the cards to have a conversation with you.

## 2. Focus on yourself
You're the only person you can change. Instead ask about how you should react to other people, not what they'll do to you. It's tempting to ask if your ex will come back to you, but you'll get a better reading if you ask what you need

## 3. Watch your language
The way you phrase your questions can shut down or open up a reading. Instead of asking "Who is.." or "When will.." questions try "What do I need to know about..." or "How can I..."

## 4. Stay positive!
Positive questions will give you more productive answers. Asking how you can get what you want will give you a game plan, just asking why you don't have it can invite a pity party or a pile on.
