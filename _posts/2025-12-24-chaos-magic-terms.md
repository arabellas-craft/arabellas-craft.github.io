If you've tried to learn chaos magic from online forums or classic texts like *[Liber Null](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781578637669)*, you've probably hit a wall of unexplained jargon. Experienced practitioners use terms like "gnosis," "servitor," and "paradigm shifting" as if everyone already knows what they mean.

Even foundational books assume you have prior occult knowledge that many modern practitioners don't have.

This creates a problem. Chaos magic's anti-dogmatic philosophy resists standardization, which is philosophically consistent but practically frustrating. You end up with vocabulary you can't define, techniques you can't understand, and debates you can't follow.

This glossary fixes that. Read through it once to get oriented, then bookmark it for when you encounter these terms in the wild. The definitions will click into place as you actually do the work.

## Pronunciation Guide

Here's how to say the terms people aren't sure about:

- **Gnosis:** NOH-sis ([hear it](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gnosis))
- **Egregore:** EGG-ruh-gore or eh-GREG-or ([hear it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNS_XdAn1BI))
- **Chaote:** kay-OAT or KAY-oat (both heard in community)
- **Sigil:** SIJ-il ([hear it](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sigil))
- **Servitor:** SUR-vih-ter ([hear it](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/servitor))

These are the most common pronunciations. Pronunciations vary regionally and between practitioners. 

## The Big Four: Essential Concepts

These four terms appear constantly and generate the most questions.

### Gnosis

Gnosis is the altered mental state where you bypass your conscious mind to work magic directly. It's the engine that powers most chaos magic techniques.

The word comes from Greek meaning "knowledge," but that's not how chaos magic uses it. 

People also expect a dramatic mystical experience. But gnosis can be surprisingly ordinary. "How do I know when I've achieved it?" is the most common question, which tells you everything about the gap between expectation and reality.

**The three types of gnosis:**

**Inhibitory gnosis** uses stillness to quiet the mind down to almost nothing. 

Methods include meditation, fasting, sensory deprivation, and Austin Osman Spare's "death posture"—a physically uncomfortable position held until the mind gives up trying to think about the discomfort.

**Excitatory gnosis** goes the opposite direction. 

The mind gets so overwhelmed by intensity that it short-circuits. Sex is the classic method, but dancing, drumming, pain, hyperventilation, and extreme physical exertion all work.

**Indifferent vacuity** is the type people don't expect because it seems too ordinary. 

This is everyday mental blankness. Forgetting why you walked into the kitchen. Highway hypnosis during a familiar drive. Performing automatic actions while your mind goes blank.

You might not realize you reached gnosis until later.

**Common questions:**

"Is gnosis just meditation?" 

No. Meditation is one path to inhibitory gnosis, but gnosis itself is the state you're trying to reach.

"Do I need gnosis every time?" 

Debated. Most practitioners say yes for best results.

"What if I can't tell if I reached it?" 

Focus on results rather than analyzing the experience in the moment.

### Servitor / Egregore / Tulpa

These three terms describe related but different entities. People use them interchangeably when they shouldn't. 

The distinction matters because they require different approaches and carry different risks.

Think of them as a spectrum from simple to complex:

**Servitor**

A task-focused thought-form you create for a specific purpose. Think of them like magical Roombas. They do one job. They don't think for themselves. You control them completely (in theory). 

A servitor should have a built-in termination method (also called a kill switch) where if a certain condition is met the servitor will be released/disassembled/otherwise returned to wherever it came from. 

**Egregore**

An entity created and sustained by group belief. It has more autonomy than a servitor and can develop beyond its creators' intentions. 

Corporate brand identities function as egregores, as do fandom entities. In chaos magic practice, deities-as-thoughtforms work this way too.

**Tulpa**

A fully sentient independent being with its own personality. 

The term originates from Tibetan Buddhist practice, though Western usage differs significantly. Tulpas raise ethical questions about creating conscious entities.


**Common questions:**

"How do I feed or maintain them?" 

Through attention, gratitude, or whatever energy source you specified during creation.

"What if I forget about my servitor?" 

Depends on your construction. Some fade without attention, some persist, some go dormant.

"Where do traditional spirits or deities fit?" 

Chaos magic often treats them as egregores or archetypes you can work with as tools.

Learn [servitor creation techniques](#servitor-article).

### Paradigm / Paradigm Shifting

Paradigm shifting means temporarily and fully adopting entire belief systems as tools, then setting them aside when you're done. 

This is chaos magic's signature technique. It's also its most conceptually challenging aspect.

**The challenge everyone faces:**

"How do I actually believe something I know I don't believe?" 

This logical paradox stops many practitioners before they start. You can't just pretend to believe. The magic requires genuine belief in the moment, even though you know you'll discard that belief later.

**What this looks like in practice:**

You might work with Norse deities and runes one week. Switch to planetary magic the next. Then use a purely psychological model the week after. 

Each time, you inhabit that worldview fully while you're in it. You believe it completely for the duration. Then you step out of it.

**The skill being developed:**

Holding beliefs lightly enough to shift between them while believing intensely enough for them to work. Think of it like method acting for your entire worldview.

Peter Carroll suggested rolling dice to randomly select which paradigm to work in, then committing to it for a set period. This removes the temptation to cherry-pick based on comfort rather than effectiveness.

**Common questions:**

"Isn't this superficial?" 

The practice is about discovering what works through experimentation, not achieving permanent conversion.

"How is this different from cultural appropriation?" 

Respect for source traditions still matters. Paradigm shifting doesn't exempt you from doing your homework or give you a free pass to ignore closed practices and cultural boundaries.

"Do I have to switch constantly?" 

No. Shift as often or rarely as serves your work.

**An example:**

You might use Christian prayer for emotional comfort. Norse runes for protection work. A psychological model for self-analysis. 

You're not claiming to be Christian, Norse Heathen, and Jungian psychologist simultaneously. You're using each framework when it's the best tool for that specific job.

### Sigil

A sigil is a symbol you create to represent an intention, charge with energy during gnosis, then release and forget. 

It's chaos magic's most accessible technique.

The term comes from Latin "sigillum" meaning "seal." Austin Osman Spare developed the modern method.

**The terminology confusion:**

Three terms get mixed up constantly:

| Term | Actual Meaning | Common Confusion |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Charging** | Infusing the sigil with energy via gnosis | Often conflated with firing |
| **Firing** | The moment of release/activation | Used interchangeably with charging |
| **Activating** | Vague term different authors use differently | Sometimes means the whole process |

Use "charging" for the energy work and "firing" for the release moment. Avoid "activating" since it's ambiguous.

**The forgetting paradox:**

Austin Osman Spare emphasized forgetting sigils completely after firing them. 

Beginners reasonably ask, "How am I supposed to forget something I just did?"

The clarification: You'll remember that you did a sigil working, but you deliberately direct your attention elsewhere. Don't obsessively check for results or replay the working mentally. 

The goal is avoiding conscious interference, not literal amnesia.

Think of it like planting a seed. You plant it, water it, then leave it alone. Digging it up every day to check if it's growing kills the plant.

**"Lust for results":**

This phrase appears in every "why didn't my sigil work?" discussion.

It describes desperate attachment to outcomes, which spoils the working. Constantly checking, worrying, or obsessing creates mental interference.

The distinction: There's a difference between healthy desire (you want the thing) and obsessive attachment (you can't stop thinking about whether the magic worked). 

The first is fine. The second kills the working.

## Core Philosophy Terms

These concepts form chaos magic's philosophical foundation. Brief definitions for quick reference; [explore them in depth in this article](/chaos-magic-belief-as-tool).

### Chaos

In chaos magic, "chaos" refers to infinite possibility. The underlying reality beyond perception. Similar to concepts like Brahman in Hinduism or Tao in Taoism.

What chaos doesn't mean: disorder, randomness, destructive confusion, or "anything goes" nihilism.

This matters because the entire practice is named after a commonly misunderstood word. 

"Chaos" means the raw potential from which reality emerges, not mess or mayhem. Peter Carroll chose the term to describe the formless source of all possibility. The space where all paradigms exist simultaneously before you choose which one to work within.

### Belief as a Tool

Beliefs are useful instruments you can pick up and put down, not permanent truths you must defend.

Traditional magic often requires genuine, permanent belief in specific cosmologies. Chaos magic treats belief systems as functional rather than factual. 

A belief system is true if it works, false if it doesn't.

### Nothing is true, everything is permitted

Often interpreted as nihilistic "nothing matters" worldview, which misses the point.

What it actually means: Reality is more flexible than consensus teaches, so all paradigms become available as tools. No single belief system has exclusive claim to truth.

The phrase is attributed to Hassan-i Sabbāh (though this is debated), popularized by William S. Burroughs, and became a chaos magic motto. 

It's about freedom of methodology, not moral relativism.

### Results-based magic

Magic is judged by whether it produces results, not by whether it follows traditional forms or procedures.

Why this matters: If a technique works, use it. If it doesn't work, modify or discard it. 

Correct procedure matters less than actual outcomes. You're performing experiments to discover what produces the effects you want, not honoring tradition or pleasing deities.

The ongoing debate: How do you distinguish magical results from coincidence or placebo effect? The community discusses this constantly without consensus.

## Practice Mechanics

Terms you'll encounter while actually doing the work.

### Charging

In the context of sigils: Infusing the symbol with energy during gnosis.

In general magical practice: Putting energy into any working—sigil, servitor, talisman, whatever.

Common methods: Sex, intense emotion, meditation, pain, dancing, drumming, exercise to exhaustion. Anything that induces gnosis works. 

Charging happens during the gnostic state, not before or after.

### Banishing

Clearing unwanted energies, influences, or mental clutter from your space or yourself.

When to use it: 
- Before workings (creates a clean slate)
- After workings (closes what you opened)
- When your space or headspace feels "off"

The common chaos magic method is the [Gnostic Pentagram Ritual](https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/rites/gpr.html), a simplified version of the [Golden Dawn's Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_ritual_of_the_pentagram). 

The Gnostic version strips out the Kabbalistic symbolism and Judeo-Christian framework, keeping just the basic structure.

The debate: How necessary is banishing? Some practitioners consider it essential, others treat it as optional. You'll develop your own practice.

### Invocation vs. Evocation

**Invocation:** Drawing an entity or energy INTO yourself. 

You're channeling a deity, embodying an archetype, temporarily becoming the thing you're invoking.

**Evocation:** Calling an entity to appear OUTSIDE yourself. 

You're summoning a spirit to communicate with, but the entity remains separate from you.

In chaos magic, both are tools for different purposes. Neither is inherently superior.

**Related term - Godform:** A deity or archetype you invoke and embody as part of paradigm shifting. You take on that god's attributes, perspective, and power for the duration.

## The Underdocumented Jargon

These terms appear constantly in chaos magic discussions, but experienced practitioners use them without defining them.

### From the IOT (Illuminates of Thanateros)

The Illuminates of Thanateros was the first formal chaos magic organization, founded by Peter Carroll and Ray Sherwin in 1978. 

Read [the full history](/history-of-chaos-magic), but the short version: the IOT developed terminology that persists throughout chaos magic literature even if you're never involved with the organization.

**The Pact:** Shorthand for the IOT itself.

**Grade system:**
- 4° Neophyte (beginner)
- 3° Initiate
- 2° Adept
- 1° Magus (advanced)

You'll see these referenced in forums, especially in older discussions.

**Ouranian Barbaric:** A ritual language the IOT developed, constructed from various linguistic sources. Meant to bypass semantic meaning and work directly with sound and intention.

Why this matters: IOT terminology appears throughout chaos magic literature even in texts unrelated to the organization.

### From Liber Null

Peter Carroll's *[Liber Null & Psychonaut](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781578637669)* is divided into sections with Latin names. 

When someone says "that's covered in LUX," they're referring to a specific section:

- **Liber MMM:** Basic exercises for developing gnosis
- **Liber LUX:** "Light" practices
- **Liber NOX:** "Dark" practices
- **Liber AOM:** Advanced topics

### From Grant Morrison

Comic book author Grant Morrison popularized chaos magic concepts through their work, particularly *The Invisibles*.

**Hypersigil:** An extended sigil using narrative elements. 

Instead of a simple symbol, you create entire stories, comics, or long-term projects as magical operations. Morrison described *[The Invisibles](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781799506683)* as "a six-year-long sigil."

**Fiction suit:** Using fictional characters or personas as magical identities. You put on a character like putting on a suit of clothes.

**Pop magic:** Morrison's term for an accessible approach using pop culture elements rather than traditional occult imagery. Why use ancient Egyptian deities when you can work with superheroes or corporate logos?

### From Internet/Meme Magic Culture

These terms evolved in online communities before connecting to broader chaos magic practice.

**Kek:** Egyptian frog deity appropriated as a chaos magic symbol in certain online communities, particularly 4chan. The association happened through coincidences involving World of Warcraft (where "kek" is how Horde players see Alliance players' "lol") and Pepe the Frog memes. This got weird when alt-right communities adopted Pepe, creating uncomfortable associations. Many chaos magicians now avoid Kek symbolism.

**Hyperstition:** Ideas or fictions that make themselves real through collective belief and circulation. Related to egregores but emphasizes the feedback loop: the idea spreads, people act as if it's real, their actions make it functionally real, which makes it spread more.

**Gets/Dubs:** Internet culture (particularly 4chan) practice of treating post number synchronicities as magical confirmation. If your post number ends in repeating digits, it's seen as significant. Some practitioners use this as divination.

### Common Abbreviations

- **CM/CMK:** Chaos Magic/Magick
- **AOS:** Austin Osman Spare
- **TOPY:** Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (performance art/magic collective)
- **ZKC:** Zos Kia Cultus (Austin Osman Spare's magical system)
- **LHP/RHP:** Left-Hand Path / Right-Hand Path
- **UPG:** Unverified Personal Gnosis (personal spiritual experience, not from tradition)
- **GPR:** Gnostic Pentagram Ritual

## Borrowed Terms Worth Knowing

Chaos magic remixes concepts from various traditions. These terms appear frequently enough to warrant inclusion.

### The Kia

From Austin Osman Spare's magical system. Your essential self or consciousness beneath identity and ego.

How it's used: Accessing the Kia allows you to reshape beliefs and reality at a fundamental level. You're working with the part of yourself that exists before personality, conditioning, or learned beliefs.

Do you need this concept? No. It's one model among many. You'll encounter it in discussions of Spare's work and in some chaos magic theory, but you can practice effectively without it.

### The Eight-Circuit Model

From Timothy Leary's consciousness research, popularized in occult contexts by Robert Anton Wilson. 

The model proposes eight levels or "circuits" of consciousness, from basic survival instincts to cosmic awareness.

Why some chaos magicians use it: Provides a framework for understanding reality tunnels (the limited slice of reality your current consciousness perceives) and paradigm shifting.

Do you need it? Completely optional. One of many available models for conceptualizing consciousness and belief.

### Chaote

A chaos magic practitioner. 

Pronunciation: kay-OAT or KAY-oat, both heard in community.

Usage note: Mixed feelings in the community. Some embrace it, others find it unnecessary or cringey. Just say "chaos magician" or "practitioner" if "chaote" doesn't feel right.

## The "Magic" vs. "Magick" Question

Aleister Crowley added the 'k' to distinguish occult practice from stage magic.

Current usage varies. Peter Carroll and many modern practitioners use "magic" without the k. Some keep "magick" to honor Crowley or by personal preference. 

The distinction matters less now than it did in the 1990s.

The spelling doesn't affect the practice. Use whichever feels right.

Chaos magic's anti-dogmatic philosophy means definitions vary between practitioners. This is a feature, not a bug. The practice encourages you to develop your own understanding and even create your own terminology as your work evolves.

If a term still confuses you, you're not alone. The chaos magic community continues active discussions about these concepts across forums, Discord servers, and social media. The confusion is part of the learning process.
