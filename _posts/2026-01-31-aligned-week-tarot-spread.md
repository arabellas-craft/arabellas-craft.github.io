**A simple 4 card tarot spread for the week ahead. Check in with external circumstances, internal state, and where to find your power each week.**

Most weekly tarot spreads focus on what's coming at you. This one adds something different: where your external circumstances meet your internal landscape, and what to do with that intersection.

You don't need special preparation for this spread. Use whatever deck you have. Pull cards Sunday evening or Monday morning. Take five minutes or take twenty.

## How the Aligned Week Tarot Spread Works

This is a straightforward four-card spread. No complex layouts, no memorizing elaborate positions.

**Card 1: External circumstances**
What's happening around you this week. The situations, events, and people that will shape your days.

**Card 2: Internal landscape**
Your emotional and mental state. What you're processing, feeling, or working through internally.

**Card 3: Where these meet**
What gets created when your circumstances collide with your internal world. This position shows the actual experience you'll have.

**Card 4: How to work with it**
Where your power lives this week. What actions, attitudes, or awareness will serve you best.

The third position is what makes this spread work. Your week isn't just what happens to you (card 1) or how you feel about it (card 2). The real experience lives in that overlap.

## Reading the Spread

Start with cards 1 and 2 separately. What's the external situation? What's your internal state?

Then look at card 3. How do those two energies combine? Sometimes they amplify each other. Sometimes they create tension. Sometimes one transforms the other.

Card 4 tells you where to place your attention. Not necessarily what to do, but where your agency lives. This might be an action, an attitude shift, a boundary, or simply awareness.

## When to Use This Spread

Sunday evenings work well. Monday mornings too. Whenever you want to orient yourself before the week begins.

You can also pull this spread mid-week when you feel scattered or reactive. It helps you see what's actually happening versus what you're making it mean.

Some people use this spread weekly for months, creating a record of patterns. Others reach for it situationally when weeks feel particularly complex.

## Making It Your Own

The spread works as written, but you can adapt it.

Want more detail on the fourth card? Pull a clarifier specifically for where to find your power.

Working with a specific challenge? Frame card 1 as "what this situation brings" instead of general external circumstances.

Prefer working with oracles or Lenormand? The structure translates easily. The positions aren't tarot-specific.

## What This Spread Doesn't Do

This isn't predictive. It won't tell you what specific events will happen.

It won't solve your problems. Cards 3 and 4 offer perspective, not solutions.

It won't work if you're looking for yes/no answers or trying to control outcomes.

What it does do: help you see what you're working with and where your power lives in that reality.

## Tips for Beginners

You don't need to interpret every symbol in every card. Look at the overall energy first.

Card 3 confusing you? Describe cards 1 and 2 out loud, then see what naturally emerges from combining them.

Keep readings simple. One or two sentences per card is enough for a weekly check-in.

Trust your first impressions. The cards that make you go "oh" or "ugh" are usually hitting something true.

Write down card 4 somewhere you'll see it during the week. Your phone notes, a sticky note, whatever works.

## Why This Structure

Most divination practices work best when they help you see clearly, not when they promise certainty.

This spread gives you four touchpoints: external reality, internal reality, their intersection, and your agency. That's enough information to work with without creating overwhelm.

The structure also resists magical thinking. You're not trying to manifest a perfect week or avoid difficult cards. You're checking in with what is and finding where you have choice within that.

Weekly tarot becomes a practice of orientation rather than prediction. You're not asking what will happen. You're asking how to show up for what's happening.
