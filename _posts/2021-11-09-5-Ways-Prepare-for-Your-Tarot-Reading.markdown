## 1. Find the right reader
Finding a good tarot reader can be difficult! Before [booking a reading](/tarot-reading) with someone you'll want to read their [about](/about) page to how they view themselves and tarot and make sure your views on tarot align. Some people see tarot as more of a self-reflection tool, and others are more into the fortune telling side of things.

You'll also want to double check their policies to make sure they do the kind of reading you're looking for. Lots of readers won't do readings about health, legal matters, or fertility.

## 2. Know Yourself
This step can sometimes be the hardest for people. When you're coming into a tarot reading it is important to take a minute to acknowledge what outcomes you're hoping for. Do you want your ex back? A new job to fall in your lap? The promise of success in a new business venture? The cards may not be able to give you the answer you're hoping for (although they might be able to give you some advice to work towards it if you phrase your question correctly). But, knowing the goals you want to work towards is the first step towards finding your question(s).

## 3. Come up with your question(s)
One of the best way to prepare yourself for a tarot reading is to come in with a good question (or questions). This is a big enough topic that it needs it's own article! Check out [How to ask the Right Questions](/good-questions-for-tarot-readings/) for more information. Bottom line, if you aren't sure how to phrase your question, let your reader know and they'll be able to help you!

## 4. Center yourself
Making sure you're in the right headspace for a reading is important. Make sure you're relaxed and centered before you begin. You can do that however works best for you. Meditate, take a walk, journal, whatever works for you. Get some rest, rechange, and focus on yourself before the reading starts. It will put you in a better headspace to absorb the information and get the most from the cards.


## 5. Record the reading or take notes
If you're getting a live reading you may think you'll remember everything, but you'd be surprised by how quickly things fade from memory! Asking the reader if you can record the session is the easiest way to be able to reference it later, although some readers may prefer that you don't, in which case you'll have to take notes. This is a bit easier to deal with when the reader isn't reading live as they'll give you a record of the reading generally either by [email](/tarot-reading), audio or video.
