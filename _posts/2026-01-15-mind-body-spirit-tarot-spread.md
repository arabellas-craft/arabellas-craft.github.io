Something's wrong but you can't say what. Work stress? Bad sleep? Emotional exhaustion? When everything blurs together, you need to separate the threads.

This three-card spread does that. Body, mind, spirit, three cards to show which area needs attention first.

## Why Three Cards

Three cards forces clarity. Pull the Eight of Swords in your Mind position and you see your thought patterns are the problem—blindfolded figure surrounded by swords speaks for itself.

This works as a more robust daily check-in than a single card pull. Five minutes, three cards, done.

## When to Use This

Use it when you need to untangle physical exhaustion from mental spiraling from deeper emotional depletion. Use it when everything hurts but you can't pinpoint what needs fixing first.

Don't use it for decisions about other people or external situations. This reads your internal state, not external outcomes.

## The Positions

**Body: What does my physical self need?**

Not "what self-care ritual should I perform" but what does your actual body need. 

Four of Swords? Your body needs rest, not gentle yoga. Three of Wands? You've been sitting too long. Ten of Pentacles? You're neglecting practical needs—doctor's appointments, decent meals, a functional living space.

**Mind: What thought patterns need attention?**

Your brain is always telling you stories that frame how you see the world. This position shows which ones are affecting you currently.

Wands here can mean you're done with thinking and ready for action. Swords in this position usually mean your thoughts are holding you back. Cups mean you're making decisions based on emotions. While Pentacles indicate overthinking practical matters that need action.

**Spirit: What does my inner self need?**

The part of you underneath all your obligations. The person you are when nobody's asking you for anything.

The Hermit? Desperate for solitude. Three of Cups? Withering from lack of connection. The Tower? Something's breaking because you've ignored this too long.

## Example Reading: Burnout

You can't focus, you're irritable, you barely remember what "okay" feels like.

You pull: Four of Swords (Body), Eight of Swords (Mind), The Star (Spirit)

**Four of Swords** - Your body demands you stop. Not rest between activities. Full stop. This shows up when you've been saying "I'll rest after just one more thing." Your body stopped negotiating.

**Eight of Swords** - Your mind is creating the prison. The work stress feels overwhelming because your thoughts keep building walls that don't exist. You're catastrophizing every deadline, turning every email into evidence you're failing.

**The Star** - Your inner self needs to remember this won't last forever. You're so buried in immediate stress you've forgotten renewal exists. You need something that reminds you the world is bigger than your current crisis.

What to do: Rest isn't optional. Your catastrophic thinking is making everything worse. Find something that gives you perspective—nature, art, a friend who'll tell you straight that you're spiraling.

## Making This Useful

Pull these three cards in the morning. Takes less time than scrolling social media.

Or pull weekly and track patterns. If Mind consistently shows Swords, your thought patterns are your main problem. If Body keeps showing the same card, you're ignoring it. If Spirit shows isolation repeatedly, you know what needs addressing.

The spread works because it's not trying to be profound. Three cards, three questions, actionable information.
