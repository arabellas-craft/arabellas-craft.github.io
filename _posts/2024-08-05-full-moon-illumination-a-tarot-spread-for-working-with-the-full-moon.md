The full moon is a powerful time for reflection, release, and setting intentions. Just as the moon's light illuminates the night, a full moon tarot spread can illuminate your path, revealing what needs to be shed, appreciated, and embraced. If you're new to tarot, this simple yet insightful spread is the perfect way to connect with the moon's magic and gain clarity in your life.

## How to use this full moon tarot spread?
1. Preparation: Find a quiet, peaceful space where you won't be disturbed. Light a candle, burn some incense, or play calming music to set the mood.
2. Shuffling and Selecting: Shuffle your tarot deck while focusing on your intentions for the reading. When you feel ready, select four cards and place them face down in the following order:
    * Card 1: What am I ready to release? This card represents something you need to let go of to move forward in your life. It could be a limiting belief, a past hurt, or a bad habit.
    * Card 2: What am I grateful for? This card highlights the blessings in your life, fostering a positive mindset. Gratitude is a powerful tool for attracting more abundance.
    * Card 3: What is beginning? This card points to a new path, opportunity, or aspect of yourself that is ready to blossom. It signifies fresh starts and exciting possibilities.
    * Card 4: The Moon's Message: This card offers guidance and insight from the universe, supporting you on your journey. It's a message of encouragement and wisdom.

3. Revealing and Interpreting: Turn each card over one at a time, starting with the top card.  Take your time to observe the images and symbols on each card. How do they resonate with you? Trust your intuition and let the meanings unfold. You can consult a tarot guidebook for additional interpretations, but remember that the most meaningful insights often come from within. You many need to draw additional cards for clarity.

## Tips for Beginners
* Use a Rider-Waite-Smith deck or a similar deck: These decks have clear symbolism that is easy to understand, making them ideal for beginners.
* Keep a journal: Record your interpretations and any insights that come to you during your reading. This will help you track your progress and reflect on your growth.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help: If you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to a more experienced tarot reader. The [r/tarot](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarot/) subreddit is a great place to get help or a second opinion.

Whether you're seeking clarity, guidance, or simply a deeper understanding of yourself, this spread can offer profound insights and support.
