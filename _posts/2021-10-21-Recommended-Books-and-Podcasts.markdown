## [For Small Creatures Such as We by Sasha Sagan](https://bookshop.org/books/for-small-creatures-such-as-we-rituals-for-finding-meaning-in-our-unlikely-world/9780735218772)
Sasha Sagan is the daughter of famous public scientist Carl Sagan. In this book she finds magic and tells us the way she uses ritual in her daily life while remaining entirely secular and fact-based. A must read for secular witches!

## [Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer](https://bookshop.org/books/braiding-sweetgrass-3e12996d-ea04-4dd2-b9a9-04cfd82f361f/9781571313560)
This book does an amazing job of showing how different types of "knowing" that may seem at odds can weave together and compliment one another. Kimmerer tells us how she wove together her traditional training as a botanist and knowledge of plants that she learned a citizen of the Potawatomi Nation.

## [78 Degrees of Wisdom by Rachel Pollack](https://bookshop.org/books/seventy-eight-degrees-of-wisdom-a-tarot-journey-to-self-awareness-a-new-edition-of-the-tarot-classic/9781578636655)
This one is a classic, but for good reason! Pollack goes more in-depth than almost any other book I've found on the imagery in and history of the Rider-Smith deck.

## [The Body is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor](https://bookshop.org/books/the-body-is-not-an-apology-the-power-of-radical-self-love/9781523090990)
Systems of oppression thrive off our inability to make peace with difference and injure the relationship we have with our own bodies. Taylor's solution of radical self-love offers us a chance to heal. Learning to love yourself as you are is one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself.
