## Books

### [The Dabbler's Guide to Witchcraft](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781982174347)
This is my go-to recommendation for all beginner witches. It's a wonderful introduction to the basics of witchcraft and gives you a great foundation for how to vet other sources you come across in your studies.

### [Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781571313560)
This book does an amazing job of showing how different types of "knowing" that may seem at odds can weave together and compliment one another. Kimmerer tells us how she wove together her traditional training as a botanist and knowledge of plants that she learned a citizen of the Potawatomi Nation.

### [Sacred Actions by Dana O'Driscoll](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9780764361531)
If you want to learn how to combine sustainable living with Earth-based spirituality, this is the book for you! This is a book that will meet you where you're at in your sustainability practice and give you a concrete plan for where to go next.

### [78 Degrees of Wisdom by Rachel Pollack](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781578636655)
This one is a classic, but for good reason! Pollack goes more in-depth than almost any other book I've found on the imagery in and history of the Rider-Smith deck.

### [The Body is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor](https://bookshop.org/a/84772/9781523090990)
Systems of oppression thrive off our inability to make peace with difference and injure the relationship we have with our own bodies. Taylor's solution of radical self-love offers us a chance to heal. Learning to love yourself as you are is one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself.
