The new moon marks a fresh beginning, making it an ideal time for divination and setting intentions. In this article, we'll explore creative ways to harness the energy of the new moon in your divination practices and provide journal prompts to deepen your connection with lunar cycles.

## New Moon Ritual Ideas
Around the world, there are lots of traditional beliefs and rituals that are tied to the new moon. For instance, in Ireland, it was believed that a person's behavior when they first caught sight of the new moon would influence their fate until the next new moon.

In contrast to the [full moon](/full-moon-ritual-ideas-and-journal-prompts/) which is a time for ending cycles and gratitude, the new moon is about turning inward, starting new cycles, and planning for what you want to grow while we work our way back to the full moon. The new moon is a time of stillness before growth can begin again.

The new moon is generally seen as a time to:
* Set intentions
* Plan what you'd like to accomplish this lunar cycle
* Look inward to see what needs to be attended to
* Tune into stillness
* Encourage new growth
* Some people find that their intuition is heightened during the new moon which makes it a great time to do [your own tarot reading](/free-tarot-spreads/full-moon-tarot-spread) or [get a tarot reading](https://shop.juniperdivination.com/l/MonthAheadTarotReading)

Here are some ideas to try when putting together your own new moon ritual. You can mix and match, add or subtract to any of these. Just think of them as jumping-off points for your own intuition and creativity!

## 1. Make a sacred space
For me, this is a vital step to get me into the right headspace for ritual. Surround yourself with things that taste, sound, smell, look and feel good to you and help you relax. I have certain incense and music that I only use during my moon rituals, just hearing that music or smelling that incense can instantly get me ready for ritual. I find that I prefer for things to be more tranquil during the new moon.

## 2. Ground yourself
Grounding yourself can be done in lots of different ways, but my favorite is doing a simple [body scan meditation](https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/marc/free-guided-meditations/body-scan-for-sleep) where you feel into each part of your body one after another. Another great grounding technique is the [5-4-3-2-1 technique](https://www.mondaycampaigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/destress-monday-infographic-54321-grounding-technique.png) where you name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

## 3. Journaling prompts
After grounding myself I generally start my ritual with journaling. Journaling can be a great way to connect to yourself, set intentions, and build plans or growth. Every new moon I create a sacred space (even if it's just in my house!) and spend some time journaling, with some of the following prompts:

* What goals do I want to accomplish this month?
* What do I desire?
* How can I make my dreams a reality?
* In the next month what do I want more of in my life?
* What trait do I see in other people that I wish I had?

* What boundaries am I setting to support my growth and well-being?
* What are my core values? How do I uphold them?
* What are some of the first signs that I need self-care?

## 4. Tarot Card Reading

## 5. Set intentions
The biggest part of my new moon ritual is setting intentions. As the moon grows, our ideas and intentions grow as well. There are really no wrong ways to do this! For some people simply writing their intentions down in a special place or with a special pen or ink is sufficient. Other people  like to meditate on their intentions, and sigil making (and charging) is also a popular option. Do whatever feels right to you.

## 6. Closing
After declaring my intentions for the upcoming month I normally like to do something small to close my ritual. Exactly what that that is will vary from month to month, but I may anoint myself with ritual oils, or simply thank all the entities who have helped me with my working and snuff my candles.

Embrace the transformative power of the new moon by incorporating these ritual ideas and journal prompts into your divination practice. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or new to the art of divination, the new moon offers a unique opportunity to deepen your intuitive connection and set intentions for personal growth.
