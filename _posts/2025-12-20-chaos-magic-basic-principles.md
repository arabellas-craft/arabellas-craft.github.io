Chaos magic treats belief as something you can pick up, use, and put back down.

This single idea explains what makes chaos magic different. If belief is just a tool, you don't need to hold any particular belief permanently. You can borrow techniques from other traditions, test frameworks you're not sure about, and judge everything by whether it works.

## Picking Up and Putting Down Belief

You adopt a belief system temporarily because it's useful. While you're using it, you commit fully. When you're done, you set it aside.

This isn't pretending or going through the motions. The temporary adoption has to be genuine to work.

Example: You might work a sigil for financial stability using a prosperity framework one week. The next week, you approach a difficult conversation using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. The week after, you do a tarot reading using the [good questions framework](/good-questions-for-tarot-readings) with no magical assumptions.

None of these cancel each other out. They're different tools for different situations.

Instead of asking "Is this belief true?" you ask "Is this belief useful right now?"

## "Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted"

You'll encounter this phrase in chaos magic circles. 

The phrase is attributed to [Hassan-i Sabbah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan-i_Sabbah), an 11th century founder of the Nizari Ismaili state, though the attribution is probably apocryphal. It entered Western consciousness through Friedrich Nietzsche, then William S. Burroughs, and eventually chaos magicians adopted it.

It means: no belief system has a monopoly on truth, so you're free to work with any of them. "Permitted" doesn't mean "without consequences." It means you're not metaphysically locked into one system.

The phrase has baggage. The Assassin's Creed games stripped away the philosophical context. Online spaces turned it into "I can do whatever I want." This gave chaos magic an edgelord reputation it doesn't deserve.

The original meaning: intellectual freedom and taking responsibility for your own practice. Not moral relativism. Not "nothing matters."

## Two Models, One Practice

Practitioners understand chaos magic through one of two lenses, sometimes both.

The **psychological model** treats magic as working with your own mind. Sigils communicate with your subconscious. Rituals create focus. Spirits are aspects of your psyche given form. You can practice chaos magic as a skeptic.

The **metaphysical model** treats magic as affecting external reality. Sigils send intentions into the universe. Spirits and energies exist independently of your mind. Something genuinely mysterious is happening.

Chaos magic doesn't ask you to choose. Many practitioners shift between these models depending on the work.

The question isn't which model is "really true." The question is which model helps you get results.

## Results Over Orthodoxy

Traditional magical systems measure success by adherence. Did you perform the ritual correctly? Did you use the right correspondences?

Chaos magic measures success by outcome. Did it work?

This shifts authority from tradition to experience. You judge what's effective. If a technique produces results, keep using it. If something "shouldn't" work according to theory but does, use it anyway.

Your practice evolves based on evidence, not doctrine.

This pragmatic stance also means you don't need to buy anything. The pressure to acquire tools, decks, crystals, and altar items comes from marketing, not magical necessity. A practice built on [what you already have](/divination-without-buying-anything) can be just as effective.

## Respect for Source Traditions

Chaos magic encourages working with symbols, deities, and techniques from multiple sources. This flexibility comes with responsibility.

Before adopting a technique or working with an unfamiliar symbol, do basic research. Where does it come from? Does the originating community consider the practice open or closed? Learn enough context to approach it respectfully.

Some traditions are closed practices tied to cultural identity, ancestry, or initiation requirements. Paradigm shifting doesn't give you a free pass to ignore these boundaries.

The difference between paradigm shifting and appropriation: paradigm shifting treats belief systems as functional tools while respecting their origins. Appropriation strips practices from context and ignores practitioner communities.

If you're reading about a practice before trying it, if you're curious about origins and context, you're already doing the work that matters.

## Exercise: One Week, One Lens

Choose a framework you don't currently use or take seriously. Astrology if you're skeptical of it. Stoic philosophy if you've never tried it. Animism if you've never thought of objects as having their own presence.

For one week, act as if it's true. If you chose astrology, check your horoscope daily and notice what resonates. If you chose Stoicism, apply its principles when something frustrating happens. If you chose animism, greet your houseplants and thank your coffee maker.

At the end of the week, evaluate. What shifted? Did anything useful come out of the experiment? What will you keep using, and what will you set back down?

This is practice in treating belief as something you can try on, test, and decide about based on results.

## Where This Leads

Belief as a tool is the foundation everything else in chaos magic builds on.

Once this concept clicks, the techniques make sense. Sigils work because you're encoding intention and then letting go of conscious attachment. Gnosis works because altered states bypass your normal filters. Paradigm shifting works because you're not locked into one framework.
