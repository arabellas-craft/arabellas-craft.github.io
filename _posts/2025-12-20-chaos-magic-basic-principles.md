Chaos magic treats belief as something you can pick up, use, and put back down.

This single idea explains most of what makes chaos magic different from other approaches to magical practice. If belief is just a tool, you don't need to hold any particular belief permanently. You can borrow techniques from other traditions (or even pop culture), test frameworks you're not sure about, and judge everything by whether it actually works rather than whether you followed the rules.

Once you understand this concept, everything else in chaos magic clicks into place.

## Picking Up and Putting Down Belief

The core concept works like this: you can adopt a belief system temporarily because it's useful for what you're trying to accomplish. While you're using it, you commit fully. When you're done, you set it aside.

This isn't pretending. It's not ironic detachment or going through the motions while secretly thinking it's all nonsense. The temporary adoption has to be genuine to work. You're fully in it while you're in it.

A practical example: you might work a sigil for financial stability using a prosperity-focused framework one week. The next week, you might approach a difficult conversation using techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy. The week after that, you might do a tarot reading using the [good questions framework](/good-questions-for-tarot-readings) with no magical assumptions at all.

None of these cancel each other out. They're different tools for different situations.

The shift this creates is significant. Instead of asking "Is this belief true?" you ask "Is this belief useful right now?" Instead of defending a worldview against challenges, you're testing tools and keeping what works.

## "Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted"

You'll encounter this phrase in chaos magic circles. It has a complicated history and an unfortunate reputation, both worth understanding.

The phrase is attributed to [Hassan-i Sabbah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan-i_Sabbah), the 11th century founder of the Nizari Ismaili state, though the attribution is probably apocryphal. It entered Western consciousness through Friedrich Nietzsche, then William S. Burroughs, and eventually Peter Carroll and the early chaos magicians. They adopted it as shorthand for the belief-as-tool concept.

In context, the phrase means something specific: no belief system has a monopoly on truth, so you're free to work with any of them. "Permitted" doesn't mean "without consequences." It means you're not metaphysically locked into one system. You can move between frameworks based on what's useful.

The phrase has baggage. The Assassin's Creed video game franchise adopted it as a cool-assassin motto, stripping away the philosophical context entirely. Online spaces turned it into shorthand for "I can do whatever I want." This gave chaos magic an edgelord reputation.

The original meaning runs almost opposite to how it gets misused. It's about intellectual freedom and taking responsibility for your own practice. It's not moral relativism. It's not "nothing matters." If someone uses this phrase to justify being careless or cruel, they've missed the point entirely.

## Two Models, One Practice

Practitioners tend to understand chaos magic through one of two lenses, sometimes both.

The psychological model treats magic as a way of working with your own mind. Sigils communicate with your subconscious. Rituals create focus and clarify intention. If you encounter "spirits" or "entities," they're aspects of your own psyche given form. This model requires no supernatural claims. You can practice chaos magic as a skeptic and understand everything you're doing in purely psychological terms.

The metaphysical model treats magic as affecting external reality in some way. Sigils send intentions into the universe or tap into a collective unconscious. Spirits and energies exist independently of your mind. Something genuinely mysterious is happening, even if you can't fully explain the mechanism.

Chaos magic doesn't ask you to choose. Many practitioners shift between these models depending on the work. You might approach sigil magic psychologically while taking a more animist view when working with a place or object. The question isn't which model is "really true." The question is which model helps you get results in this particular situation.

This flexibility is part of why chaos magic appeals to people who want to experiment without signing up for a complete metaphysical worldview.

## Results Over Orthodoxy

Traditional magical systems often measure success by adherence. Did you perform the ritual correctly? Did you use the right correspondences? Did you follow the established procedure?

Chaos magic measures success by outcome. Did it work?

This shifts authority from tradition to experience. You become the judge of what's effective for you. If a technique produces results, keep using it. If something "shouldn't" work according to established theory but does, use it anyway. If an elaborate ritual falls flat while a simple technique delivers, trust your experience.

Your practice evolves based on evidence, not doctrine. This is why chaos magic has no sacred texts you must study, no required beliefs you must hold, no hierarchy telling you what's permitted. The only real test is whether your practice produces the outcomes you're looking for.

This pragmatic stance also means you don't need to buy anything. The pressure to acquire tools, decks, crystals, and altar items comes from marketing, not from magical necessity. A practice built on [what you already have](/divination-without-buying-anything) can be just as effective as one built on purchases. Often more so, because you're not confusing acquisition with progress.

## Borrowing, Research, and Respect

Chaos magic encourages working with symbols, deities, and techniques from multiple sources. This flexibility comes with responsibility.

Some traditions are closed, meaning they're not meant to be practiced by outsiders. This often traces back to histories of colonialism, cultural survival, or initiation requirements. Other practices are open but carry context that matters.

The good news: if you're doing your research, you don't need to worry about accidentally stumbling into appropriation.

Before adopting a technique or working with an unfamiliar symbol, look into where it comes from. Check whether the originating community considers the practice open or closed. Learn enough context to approach it respectfully. This isn't a high bar. It's basic due diligence.

The people who cause harm are usually the ones who grab whatever looks interesting without asking questions. If you're reading about a practice before trying it, if you're curious about origins and context, you're already doing the work that matters.

The chaos magic ethos of experimentation doesn't override cultural respect. Being flexible with belief doesn't mean being careless with other people's sacred traditions.

## Exercise: One Week, One Lens

Here's a concrete way to practice holding belief lightly.

Choose a framework you don't currently use or take seriously. This might be astrology if you're skeptical of it, Stoic philosophy if you've never tried it, or animism if you've never thought of objects and places as having their own presence. It could be something as mundane as a productivity system you've dismissed.

For one week, act as if it's true. If you chose astrology, check your horoscope daily and notice what resonates. If you chose Stoicism, apply its principles when something frustrating happens. If you chose animism, greet your houseplants, thank your coffee maker, notice how it feels to treat objects as participants rather than things.

At the end of the week, evaluate. What shifted in your thinking or behavior? Did anything useful come out of the experiment? What will you keep using, and what will you set back down?

This isn't magic. It's practice in treating belief as something you can try on, test, and decide about based on results.

## Where This Leads

Belief as a tool is the foundation that everything else in chaos magic builds on.

Once this concept clicks, the techniques make sense. Sigils work because you're encoding intention and then letting go of conscious attachment. Gnosis works because altered states bypass your normal filters. Paradigm shifting works because you're not locked into one framework.

History tells you where chaos magic came from. Philosophy tells you how it works. The next step is learning the vocabulary: the terms and concepts you'll encounter as you go deeper. [Key Terms and Concepts in Chaos Magic](/chaos-magic-key-terms) covers the language you'll need.
