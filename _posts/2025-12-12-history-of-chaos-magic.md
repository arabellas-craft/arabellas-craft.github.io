Unlike magical traditions that claim ancient or unknowable origins, chaos magic has a documented history. We know who started it, when they started it, and what they were reacting against. This isn't a drawback. It's one of the most honest things about the practice.

Chaos magic emerged in England during the late 1970s. It has founders with names and published works. It developed in a specific cultural context that shaped what it became. Understanding that context helps you understand what chaos magic is actually for.

## The 1970s Occult Landscape

To understand why chaos magic emerged, you need to know what it was pushing against.

By the 1970s, Western occultism was dominated by established traditions with formal structures. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn had developed an elaborate system of grades, rituals, and correspondences in the late 1800s. Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley in the early 1900s, offered its own complex framework. Wicca, formalized by Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, was growing rapidly and had its own initiatory degrees and required practices.

These traditions produced valuable material. They also shared certain tendencies: hierarchical structures, lengthy study requirements, expensive tools and regalia, and the expectation that practitioners would commit to specific belief systems.

Some practitioners found this frustrating. They wanted to *do* magic, not spend years working through grades or saving up for ritual equipment. They questioned whether all the elaborate ceremony was actually necessary or just accumulated tradition that no one had bothered to test.

## The Founders

Two figures are credited with founding chaos magic: Peter Carroll and Ray Sherwin.

Peter Carroll published *Liber Null* in 1978. The book was short, practical, and stripped of the verbose style common in occult writing. Carroll presented techniques directly, explained how to use them, and encouraged readers to experiment rather than accept anything on faith. He drew on chaos theory and quantum physics as conceptual frameworks, though these references were more metaphorical than scientific.

Ray Sherwin published *The Book of Results* the same year. Where Carroll offered a broader philosophical framework, Sherwin focused specifically on sigil magic, providing clear instructions for creating and charging sigils. His approach was equally pragmatic.

Together, Carroll and Sherwin founded the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT) in 1978. The name was deliberately provocative, combining Thanatos (death) and Eros (sex) as fundamental drives. The IOT was structured as a "magical order," but one that explicitly rejected the dogmatism of earlier orders. It was meant to be a network for experimentation, not a hierarchy dispensing authorized truth.

## Austin Osman Spare: The Grandfather of Sigils

Carroll and Sherwin didn't invent sigil magic. They drew heavily on the work of Austin Osman Spare, a British artist and occultist who lived from 1886 to 1956.

Spare developed his own magical system decades before chaos magic existed. His technique for creating sigils from statements of intent, then charging them and forgetting them, became foundational to chaos magic practice. He also emphasized the role of the subconscious mind and what he called the "kia" or life force.

Spare worked largely in obscurity. He rejected the organized occult scene of his time and lived in poverty in south London, producing art and developing his idiosyncratic system. Chaos magicians rediscovered his work and recognized him as a forerunner. They adapted his techniques into a broader framework.

If you're interested in the history of other divination methods that developed outside mainstream traditions, [the history of playing card divination](/playing-card-divination-unveiling-its-roots-and-history) covers similar territory.

## The Cultural Moment

Chaos magic didn't emerge in a vacuum. The late 1970s in Britain was a specific cultural moment.

Punk rock was in full swing, with its DIY ethos and rejection of bloated, overproduced rock music. The attitude was: you don't need to be a virtuoso to start a band. Just pick up a guitar and play. Chaos magic applied the same logic to occultism. You don't need years of training to do magic. Just try something and see if it works.

Postmodernism was reshaping philosophy and the arts, questioning grand narratives and fixed meanings. The idea that truth was constructed rather than discovered, that you could play with frameworks rather than being trapped by them, fit neatly with the chaos magic approach to belief.

Discordianism, a "joke religion" founded in the late 1950s that worshipped Eris, goddess of chaos and discord, also influenced early chaos magicians. Discordianism treated seriousness itself as a trap, using humor and absurdity as spiritual tools. This playfulness found its way into chaos magic's willingness to work with pop culture, fictional entities, and deliberately absurd frameworks.

## How It Spread

The IOT established "pacts" (local groups) in various countries throughout the 1980s. Chaos magic spread through these networks and through zines and small press publications.

*Chaos International*, a magazine dedicated to chaos magic, ran from 1986 to 2004 and provided a forum for practitioners to share techniques and debate ideas.

The publication of Phil Hine's *Condensed Chaos* in 1995 marked another turning point. Hine wrote in an accessible, practical style that made chaos magic approachable to newcomers. The book remains one of the most recommended introductions to the practice.

Grant Morrison, the comic book writer, brought chaos magic concepts to a wider audience through works like *The Invisibles* in the 1990s. Morrison spoke openly about their magical practice in interviews and incorporated sigil techniques into their creative process.

The internet accelerated everything. Forums, websites, and later social media allowed chaos magic ideas to spread far beyond the small network of the IOT. The decentralized, anti-authoritarian nature of chaos magic suited the internet well. There was no central organization controlling the message.

## Chaos Magic Today

Today, chaos magic has no central authority, no official doctrine, and no gatekeepers deciding who counts as a "real" practitioner.

This is by design. The founders explicitly rejected the model of magical orders that controlled access to knowledge and required advancement through ranks. They wanted a practice that belonged to whoever found it useful.

The result is a loose, global community of practitioners who share techniques, argue about theory, and experiment constantly. Some work within the IOT structure. Many have no formal affiliation at all. Chaos magic ideas have influenced the broader witchcraft and occult communities, even among people who don't identify as chaos magicians.

The lack of gatekeeping means anyone can claim the label, which occasionally produces cringe-worthy results. It also means the practice remains alive and evolving rather than frozen in the interpretations of a founding generation.

## Further Reading

If you want to explore the history of chaos magic more deeply, these sources offer scholarly or historically grounded perspectives:

- Dave Evans, *The History of British Magic After Crowley* (2007)
- Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, eds., *Contemporary Esotericism* (2013), particularly the chapters on chaos magic
- Original interviews and essays by Carroll, Sherwin, and Hine for primary source material

I'm not listing the foundational texts like *Liber Null* or *Condensed Chaos* here because they're practical manuals, not histories. They're worth reading if you want to practice, but they won't give you the critical distance of someone examining the movement from outside.

## Something to Consider

One of the stranger aspects of chaos magic history is how a movement built on rejecting gatekeeping still produced its own hierarchies and personalities and drama. The IOT has had schisms and controversies. Certain names carry more weight than others. Online spaces can be just as cliquish as any lodge.

This doesn't invalidate the practice. It's a reminder that humans form hierarchies almost automatically, even when we're trying not to. Knowing the history helps you see chaos magic as a human project with human flaws, not a perfect system handed down from somewhere.

History tells you where something came from. Philosophy tells you how it actually works. The next post in this series digs into the core idea that makes chaos magic distinct from other practices: the concept of belief as a tool. What does it mean to adopt a belief temporarily? Why would you want to? And how does this shift change your relationship to magic and practice? [Core Philosophy: Belief as a Tool](/chaos-magic-belief-as-tool) explores these questions.
