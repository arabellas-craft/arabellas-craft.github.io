Chaos magic isn't ancient. It doesn't claim roots in forgotten civilizations or secret lineages passed down through centuries. It started in England in the late 1970s, and we know exactly who started it and why.

This traceable history is actually part of what makes chaos magic interesting. You can read the original texts. You can find interviews with the founders. There's no mystery about where it came from, which means you can evaluate it on its own terms rather than taking someone's word about its legitimacy.

Here's how it happened.

## The Landscape of Western Occultism in the 1970s

To understand why chaos magic emerged, it helps to know what else was available to someone interested in magic in 1970s Britain.

The dominant traditions included ceremonial magic descended from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley's Thelema, and the growing Wiccan movement. These systems offered rich symbol sets, structured training, and initiatory paths for dedicated practitioners. They also tended to require significant study, formal initiation, and commitment to specific cosmologies and ritual forms.

None of this was wrong. These traditions worked for many people and continue to thrive today. But a few young practitioners were looking for something different. Peter Carroll and Ray Sherwin were drawn to magic but wanted a more direct, experimental approach. Rather than rejecting existing traditions as invalid, they asked a different question: what's the minimum effective practice? What actually produces results when you strip away the cultural and religious trappings?

Their answer became chaos magic.

## The Founders

**Peter Carroll** began practicing magic in the early 1970s while studying science at the University of London. His scientific background shaped his approach. He wanted to understand magic in terms of technique and results rather than faith and tradition.

In 1978, Carroll published *Liber Null*, a short text that laid out the core principles of what would become chaos magic. It emphasized practical technique over elaborate theory and introduced the concept of gnosis as the engine that powers magical work. He later expanded his ideas in *Psychonaut* and *Liber Kaos*, bringing in concepts from physics and mathematics. The term "chaos" itself came partly from chaos theory, the branch of mathematics dealing with complex systems and unpredictability.

**Ray Sherwin** was Carroll's collaborator in developing chaos magic. His book *The Book of Results*, also published in 1978, focused specifically on sigil magic and how to make it work. Where Carroll leaned toward theory and framework, Sherwin emphasized practical application.

Together, Carroll and Sherwin founded the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT) in 1978. This was the first chaos magic organization, designed to provide structure for practitioners while avoiding the rigid hierarchies they'd seen elsewhere. The IOT established local groups called "pacts" across Europe and eventually North America.

Sherwin later distanced himself from organized chaos magic, preferring solitary practice. This split reflects a tension that still exists in chaos magic today: some practitioners value community and shared exploration, while others see any organization as contrary to the DIY spirit of the practice.

These aren't mythical figures shrouded in legend. They're real people who wrote books, gave interviews, and sometimes disagreed with each other publicly. You can read their work and decide for yourself what you think of it.

## Austin Osman Spare: The Grandfather of Chaos Magic

Carroll and Sherwin didn't invent sigil magic. They built on the work of Austin Osman Spare, an English artist and occultist who lived from 1886 to 1956.

Spare developed his sigil technique in the early twentieth century. His method involved condensing a statement of intent into an abstract symbol, then charging it through intense focus or exhaustion and releasing it to the subconscious mind. He believed the conscious mind got in the way of magic, so the key was to forget the sigil's meaning and let deeper parts of the psyche do the work.

Spare was largely ignored during his lifetime. He died in poverty, his magical writings known only to a small circle. Carroll and Sherwin rediscovered his work and recognized its potential. They refined his sigil technique and placed it at the center of chaos magic practice.

Spare himself wasn't a chaos magician. The term didn't exist when he was alive. But his practical, stripped-down approach to magic provided the foundation for everything that came after. If Carroll and Sherwin are the founders of chaos magic, Spare is its grandfather.

## Punk, Postmodernism, and the Cultural Moment

Chaos magic didn't emerge in a vacuum. Late 1970s England was the era of punk rock, economic instability, and widespread distrust of established institutions. The Sex Pistols released "Anarchy in the U.K." in 1976. Margaret Thatcher would become Prime Minister in 1979. It was a moment when questioning authority felt not just acceptable but necessary.

Chaos magic shares punk's DIY ethos. Make your own rules. Don't wait for permission. Figure it out yourself. The early chaos magicians photocopied their texts and passed them hand to hand, building a community outside traditional publishing and occult establishments.

The philosophy of postmodernism also shaped chaos magic's development. Postmodern thinkers questioned whether any single narrative or belief system could claim absolute truth. Chaos magic took this idea and made it practical: if no belief system is ultimately "true," then you can adopt and discard beliefs based on whether they're useful.

Discordianism, a satirical religion (or genuine religion disguised as satire, depending on who you ask) based around the Greek goddess of chaos, also fed into the mix. Founded in the late 1950s, Discordianism encouraged irreverence toward all belief systems, including itself. Its playful, paradoxical approach influenced chaos magic's willingness to take nothing too seriously.

## How Chaos Magic Spread

For its first decade, chaos magic remained a small movement centered in Britain and connected through the IOT and its pacts. Practitioners shared ideas through correspondence, photocopied texts, and the magazine *Chaos International*, which ran from 1986 to 1999.

The 1990s brought chaos magic to wider audiences. Phil Hine's *Condensed Chaos*, published in 1995, offered a more accessible introduction than Carroll's denser theoretical works. Grant Morrison, the comic book writer behind *The Invisibles* and *Batman*, spoke openly about practicing chaos magic and incorporated its concepts into his work, introducing the ideas to readers who'd never picked up an occult book.

The internet accelerated everything. Chaos magic found new audiences on forums, blogs, and eventually platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and TikTok. What started as a handful of British occultists questioning tradition became a global, decentralized practice.

## Chaos Magic Today

There's no central authority that controls chaos magic. No one can excommunicate you or tell you you're doing it wrong. Practitioners range from those who approach it as pure psychology to those who hold fully metaphysical beliefs about what magic does and how it works.

The DIY, experimental spirit remains the common thread. Chaos magic continues to evolve, absorbing new influences and adapting to new contexts. If you're reading this, you're part of its ongoing history.

## Where to Go From Here

Knowing where something comes from can make it easier to engage with on your own terms. Chaos magic's history is recent enough that you can read the original sources yourself and form your own opinions.

The next post in this series covers the core philosophy behind chaos magic: what it actually means to treat belief as a tool, and why that idea changes how you approach practice.

Before you move on, a question to sit with:

*Chaos magic emerged because a few people got frustrated with being told there was only one right way to do things. Have you ever encountered gatekeeping in spiritual or creative spaces? Systems that seemed designed to keep beginners out rather than welcome them in? How did that shape what you were willing to explore?*
