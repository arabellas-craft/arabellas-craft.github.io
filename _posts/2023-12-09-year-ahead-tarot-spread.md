4. The Bridge: This card represents a turning point, a significant event or transition that will propel you towards your goals. It can be a time of major decision-making or a period of intense change.
5. The Legacy: This card reveals the lasting impact of your experiences this year. It represents the wisdom gained, the relationships forged, and the mark you will leave on the world around you.
6. The Shadow: This card reveals hidden aspects of the Guiding Light, potential pitfalls or areas where you might be misled or neglectful.
