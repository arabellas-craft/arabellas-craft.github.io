You want to know about your next relationship. Not just "will I meet someone?" but the whole picture: who they might be, where you'll meet, and what you need to work on before you get there.

This eight-card spread maps the journey from where you are now to the relationship waiting for you.

## Card 1: Where You Stand Now

This card shows your current relationship energy. Are you actually ready for what you say you want? What patterns are you carrying forward from past relationships? Sometimes this card is a reality check. Sometimes it's reassuring confirmation.

## Cards 2 & 3: Your Next Relationship

Two cards because relationships are complex. These show different aspects of the person or partnership coming your way. One might point to their personality, the other to the dynamic between you. Or one shows the good stuff, the other shows the challenge you'll face together.

Don't expect a photograph here. You're getting themes and energy, not a dating profile.

## Cards 4 & 5: Where and How You'll Meet

Context matters. These cards show the circumstances surrounding your meeting. Could be literal (a workplace, through friends, at an event) or situational (when you've stopped looking, after a specific life change, through shared interests).

Pay attention to timing clues. Sometimes these cards suggest you're not meeting them tomorrow.

## Cards 6, 7 & 8: What You Need to Learn First

Here's the hard part. Three cards showing the internal work between here and there.

This isn't about fixing yourself because you're broken. It's about growth that makes you ready for partnership. Maybe you need to stop recreating the same dynamic. Maybe you need to learn to be alone without feeling desperate. Maybe you need to figure out what you actually want instead of what you think you should want.

These cards often hurt a little. That's how you know they're right.

## When to Use This Spread

New moon nights work well for beginnings and intentions. But honestly? Use it when you're genuinely ready to hear the answer, whenever that is.

Pull these cards when you're willing to do the work the last three cards ask of you. Otherwise you're just fortune-telling, and fortune-telling without follow-through is entertainment, not growth.
