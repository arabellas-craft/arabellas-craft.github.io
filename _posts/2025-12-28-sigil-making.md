If you know what [sigils are](/chaos-magic-terms-explained) and you can [achieve gnosis](/gnosis-techniques-chaos-magic) the next step is to combine them.

Sigils are chaos magic's most accessible technique, simple enough for a beginner, sophisticated enough you'll still use them years later. The process is straightforward: create a symbol representing your intention, charge it during altered state, then release and forget it.

This article covers the classic Austin Osman Spare method (sometimes called the letter-reduction method) step-by-step.

## The Mechanism

Your conscious mind interferes with magical work in two ways. It criticizes ("I'll never get that job") and it fantasizes (daydreaming about ideal outcomes instead of focusing intention). Both behaviors dilute magical workings.

Sigils bypass this interference. You encode your intention into an abstract symbol your conscious mind can't immediately decode. During gnosis, when your mental filters drop, you charge the symbol directly. The intention lands without commentary.

Whether you frame this as subconscious programming or sending intentions into the universe, the process remains the same. Chaos magic [doesn't require you to choose between frameworks](/chaos-magic-belief-as-tool). Use the model that makes the technique work for you (or use both!).

## Creating Your Sigil with the Austin Osman Spare Method

Austin Osman Spare developed this technique in the early 20th century. [Read the full history](/history-of-chaos-magic) for more about his influence on chaos magic, but what matters for practice is the method itself.

### Statement of Intent

Write your goal as a present-tense statement of will.

Use "It is my will to find steady work I enjoy," not "I want a job." Present tense. Stated as fact, not wish.

Make it specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to allow for unexpected solutions. "Financial stability" leaves room for raises, windfalls, or reduced expenses. "Exactly $10,000 by Friday" locks you into one narrow outcome.

Focus on what you desire, not on avoiding what you don't want. The encoding into symbol is what matters, not elaborate linguistic construction. Keep it direct.

### Creating the Symbol

Write out your statement of intent. Remove all vowels and repeated letters.

Example: "IT IS MY WILL TO FIND STEADY WORK I ENJOY"

Vowels removed: "T S M Y W L L T F N D S T D Y W R K J Y"

Repeated letters removed: "T S M Y W L F N D R K J"

Now arrange these letters into an abstract symbol. Combine them, overlap them, rotate them. The letters become raw material for a design. You might stack the T on the S, weave the M through the Y, turn the W sideways and merge it with the L.

The symbol should be abstract enough that you won't immediately recognize what it represents when you see it later. This prevents your conscious mind from jumping in with commentary during charging.

Aesthetics don't matter. This isn't art (unless you want it to be). A messy scrawl that captures the letters works as well as an elegant design.

### Charging the Sigil

Enter gnosis using your preferred method from (if you're unsure what those are, [learn more here](/gnosis-techniques-chaos-magic)).

While in altered state, focus intensely on the sigil. Common charging methods:

**Gaze method:** Stare at the symbol until you feel a shift or release. Your vision might blur, the symbol might seem to pulse or move. When something breaks, when the focus suddenly snaps, that's the moment.

**Visualization:** See the sigil burning, dissolving, or exploding. Watch it transform into light or smoke. The intensity of the visualization matters more than the specific imagery.

**Physical destruction:** Some practitioners destroy the physical symbol at the peak of gnosis. Burn it, tear it up, throw it away. Some people care sigils into baked good so they can eat it! The act of destruction becomes the release.

The moment of firing: let it go completely. Feel the intention leave your hands. The working is done.

### After Charging

Redirect attention elsewhere immediately.

The "forgetting" isn't literal amnesia. You'll remember doing the working. What you avoid is obsessively replaying it mentally or constantly checking for results. You're trying to avoid [lust for results](/chaos-magic-terms-explained), the desperate attachment that spoils the working.

Some practitioners destroy the physical sigil after charging. Others keep them in a notebook or folder and forget about them until they stumble across them months later. Both approaches work.

Trust the process is complete.

## Your First Sigil

Let's work through a low-stakes example: "It is my will to have a productive week."

Remove vowels and you have: "T S M Y W L L T H V P R D C T V W K"

Remove repeated letters and that leaves you with: "T S M Y W L H V P R D C K"

From that we could make any number of designs, here are some examples I've created:

For charging, use the rhythmic [breathing method combined with the gaze technique](/gnosis-techniques-chaos-magic). Breathe rapidly for 1-2 minutes until you feel the shift. When your fingers start tingling or your vision narrows, lock your eyes on the sigil. Hold the gaze until something breaks, a sense of completion, a sudden exhale, a feeling of release.

Then look away. The working is done.

It can be good to start with something that doesn't matter much emotionally. A productive week is useful but not something you're likely to get overly invested in. This lets you learn the mechanics without the pressure of high stakes.

## Other Approaches

The letter-reduction method we just covered is the most common way to make a sigil, but variations exist.

**Pictorial sigils:** Draw your desire directly, then abstract it. Sketch a house for "I have stable housing," then simplify the sketch until it becomes symbolic rather than representational.

**Mantra sigils:** Reduce your statement to syllables and chant them during gnosis. "It is my will to find steady work" becomes "ITMYWILFINSTEDWOR" or simplified further to create a rhythmic chant.

**Chaos wheel:** Draw a circle divided into sections, assign letters to each section, trace lines connecting the letters of your statement to create a geometric pattern.

**Digital sigils:** Same process using drawing software instead of pen and paper. Some practitioners charge these on-screen, others print and charge the physical copy.

All methods share the core principle: create symbol, charge in gnosis, release.

## Common Questions

**"How long until it works?"**

There's no set timeline. Hours to months. Stop checking.

**"Can I charge multiple sigils at once?"**

Technically yes. This is called shoaling or grouping and works well when breaking down complex goals into smaller pieces. But it can dilute focus. Beginners should start with one at a time until they're comfortable adding more.

**"What if nothing happens?"**

There are no guarantees in magic. Sometimes things don't work. Review your process, make adjustments and try again.

**"Do I need to banish first?"**

Optional. Some practitioners always banish before and after magical work. Others never do. Experiment and see what feels necessary for your practice.

## Next Steps

Sigils combine [belief-as-tool](/chaos-magic-belief-as-tool) with [gnosis](/gnosis-techniques-chaos-magic) to create change. The technique is simple enough to start immediately but deep enough that experienced practitioners still rely on it.

Master this before moving to more complex work. Sigils teach you the fundamental rhythm of chaos magic: intention, altered state, release.
