Making decisions sucks sometimes.

You've got two paths in front of you. Both seem reasonable. You're stuck running mental loops trying to figure out which one is right. 

Should you take the job offer or stay where you are? Date person A or person B? Move or stay put?

This is where tarot shines.

Not because the cards magically know your future (they don't), but because they force you to externalize your thinking and look at angles you might be ignoring.

This quick decision spread does exactly that. 

Three cards, two options, one blind spot.

## How the Spread Works

**Card 1: If I choose Option A**  
Shows the likely outcome, energy, or consequences of choosing the first option.

**Card 2: If I choose Option B**  
Shows the likely outcome, energy, or consequences of choosing the second option.

**Card 3: What I might be overlooking**  
The factor you're not considering. The thing lurking in your blind spot that might change how you see the whole situation.

## Before You Draw Cards

Get clear on what Option A and Option B actually are.

"Should I quit my job?" isn't two options. "Should I quit my job and take the marketing position, or stay in my current role?" is two options.

Write them down if that helps. The clearer you are about what you're choosing between, the easier the cards are to interpret.

## Reading the Cards

Start with Cards 1 and 2. Look at them side by side.

Which one feels heavier? 

Which one has more challenging cards? 

Which outcome actually appeals to you when you see it laid out?

Pay attention to your gut reaction before you start intellectualizing.

Then look at the specific meanings. If you're new to tarot, here's what to look for:

**Major Arcana cards** suggest the choice has significant consequences or involves a major life lesson.

**Court cards** might represent people involved in each scenario, or aspects of yourself you'll need to embody.

**Suit associations matter.** Cups deal with emotions and relationships. Wands with passion and action. Swords with conflict and clarity. Pentacles with material concerns and stability.

**Reversed cards** (if you read reversals) often indicate blocked energy, delays, or internal rather than external experiences of that card's meaning.

## The Blind Spot Card

This is where it gets interesting.

Card 3 shows you what you're not seeing. Sometimes it's practical (The Hierophant might mean you're ignoring conventional wisdom or established procedures). Sometimes it's emotional (The Moon might mean you're not accounting for your anxiety or intuition).

This card doesn't tell you which option to choose. 

It tells you what information you're missing.

A challenging card here isn't necessarily bad. It's just something you need to factor in.

## What This Spread Doesn't Do

It doesn't make the decision for you.

You're still the one who has to choose. The cards give you information, perspective, and a mirror for your own thinking. They don't override your agency.

If you draw this spread and immediately think "oh hell no" about one of the outcomes, that's valuable information. 

Your reaction to the cards matters as much as the cards themselves.

## Tips for Clearer Readings

**One question at a time.** Don't do five variations of the same decision in one sitting. You'll just confuse yourself.

**Journal after.** Write down the cards you drew and your initial interpretation. Come back to it after you've made your decision and see what you missed or got right.

**Don't redraw if you don't like the answer.** If you pull cards you don't want to see, sit with them. They might be showing you something real.

**Context matters.** The Three of Swords means something different when you're choosing between job offers versus romantic partners.

## Using This Spread with Other Decks

This spread works with any tarot deck. Traditional RWS, modern indie decks, thrift store finds, hand-me-downs. All of them work.

It also works with oracle decks, though you'll need to adapt your interpretation since oracle decks don't follow tarot's structured system.

[Playing cards work too](https://juniperdivination.com/playing-card-divination-unveiling-its-roots-and-history). Learn the cartomancy basics (hearts = cups, clubs = wands, spades = swords, diamonds = pentacles) and you're set.

## When Not to Use This Spread

This spread assumes both options are actually viable.

If one of your "options" is staying in a dangerous situation, the cards aren't going to help you. Get practical support first.

Similarly, if you're stuck in analysis paralysis and have already done this spread three times this week about the same decision, the problem isn't lack of information. 

The problem is avoiding the decision.

## When One Reading Isn't Enough

Sometimes a tarot reading leaves you with more questions than answers. 

That's when [combining different divination methods](/combine-tarot-divination-methods) can help. Use tarot for the emotional landscape and dice for a yes/no confirmation, for example.

Or if you prefer divination without any tools at all, [bibliomancy](/bibliomancy-book-divination) offers perspective using books you already own. Open a meaningful text at random and see what wisdom appears.

## Making It Work for You

You don't need special candles, crystals, or ritual to make this spread effective.

Shuffle your deck however feels right. Draw three cards. Look at them. Think.

That's it.

Tarot works best when you strip away the performance and just use it as a thinking tool. The more barriers you put between yourself and the practice, the less likely you are to actually do it.

The idea that you need the perfect setup, the right moon phase, the expensive deck? That's marketing, not magic.

Grab whatever deck you have. Use this spread. Make your decision.

## Building a Daily Practice

Decision-making spreads work best when you already have a relationship with your cards. 

If you're new to tarot, starting with simpler daily practices helps you learn your deck's language.

The [daily check-in spread](https://juniperdivination.com/free-tarot-spreads/daily-check-in-tarot-spread) offers a gentler introduction. Three cards that show your current energy, what will help you today, and what to be mindful of. 

Or try the [three-card daily spread](https://juniperdivination.com/free-tarot-spreads/3-card-daily-tarot-spread) that focuses on what to know, what action to take, and what to release.

Daily draws teach you card meanings through experience rather than memorization. After a few weeks of consistent practice, decision spreads become much easier to interpret.
