      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me! My name is Arabella and I am a queer woman living on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone (present day San Francisco).</p>
      <p> I am passionate about enviromental justice, living sustainably, and reducing disparities within our society. I have been a practicing green witch and tarot reader for nearly 2 decades. Check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arabellas.craft/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for a better look into my daily life.</p>
      <p>As an intuitive tarot reader, I combine my intuition with my understanding of the tarot to see your core self, what you are experiencing, and the most loving way for you to proceed.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in looking at your life with more clarity please see my "<a href="reading.html">Book a Reading</a>" tab.</p>

      <h1>About Tarot</h1>
      <p>The earliest examples we have of tarot cards are from Europe in the mid-15th century. It wasn't until the 18th century that tarot cards started to be used for divination (prior to that they had been used for card games like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarocchini" target="_blank">tarocchini</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen" target="_blank">königrufen</a>).</p>
      <p>As they're used for divination today, tarot cards can answer specific questions, be used for general guidance, or focused on a specific area of life.</p>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, tarot is not a method of divination that's well suited to tell the future. Where tarot shines is in giving us new perspective on a situation or relationship and a way to connect to messages from your guides and the universe.</p>
      <p>To phrase a question for tarot you'll want to keep your question open ended, focused on yourself and your feelings, and phrased positively.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>What to Expect from a Reading</h1>
      <p>When you book a reading with me you'll receive a photo of your tarot spread as well as a detailed pdf explaining the significance of each card in your reading.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please note that readings are not a substitute for professional, qualified help. I am not an attorney, doctor or financial advisor. Therefore, I can't provide any legal, medical or financial advice.</p>
      <p>I look forward to reading for you!</p>
