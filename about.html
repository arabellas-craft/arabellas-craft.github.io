      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am an intuitive tarot reader with over 10 years of experience who can help you interpret what the cards are trying to tell you. Intuition tunes us in to our inner and outer world realities. It's awareness moves freely and is not bound by time or distance.</p>
      <p>As your intuitive tarot reader, I combine my intuition with my understanding of the tarot to see your core self, what you are experiencing, and the most loving way for you to proceed.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in looking at your life with more clarity please see my "<a href="tarot-reading.html" target="_blank">Book a Reading</a>" tab.</p>

      <h1>About Tarot</h1>
      <p>The earliest examples we have of tarot cards are from Europe in the mid-15th century. It wasn't until the 18th century that tarot cards started to be used for divination (prior to that they had been used for card games like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarocchini" target="_blank">tarocchini</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen" target="_blank">königrufen</a>).</p>
      <p>As they're used for divination today, tarot cards can answer specific questions, be used for general guidance, or focused on a specific area of life.</p>
      <p>Tarot is not a method of divination that's well suited to tell the future. Where tarot shines is in giving us new perspective on a situation or relationship and a way to connect to messages from your guides and the universe.</p>
      <p>To phrase a question for tarot you'll want to keep your question open ended, focused on yourself and your feelings, and phrased positively.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>What to Expect from a Reading</h1>
      <p>When you book a reading with me you'll receive a photo of your tarot spread as well as a detailed pdf explaining the significance of each card in your reading.</p>
      <br>
