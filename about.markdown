# About Me

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me! My name is Arabella and I am a queer woman living on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone (present day San Francisco).

I am passionate about environmental justice, living sustainably, and reducing disparities within our society. I have been a practicing hedge witch and tarot reader for over 2 decades. Check out [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arabellas.craft/) for a better look into my daily life.

As an intuitive tarot reader, I combine my intuition with my understanding of the tarot to see your core self, what you are experiencing, and the most loving way for you to proceed.

I am an eternal student, always pondering, questioning, and investigating. I hope to share this love of exploration with all those I read for. I will encourage you to think for yourself and connect with your own internal wisdom to help guide you to the answers you are seeking.

If you’re interested in looking at your life with more clarity, [book a reading](http://shop.arabellascraft.com/?sort=page_layout&tags=tarot%20card%20reading) with me.

# About Tarot

The earliest examples we have of tarot cards are from Europe in the mid-15th century. It wasn't until the 18th century that tarot cards started to be used for divination (prior to that they had been used for card games like [tarocchini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarocchini) and [königrufen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen)).

As they're used for divination today, tarot cards can answer specific questions, be used for general guidance, or focused on a specific area of life.

Contrary to popular belief, tarot is not a method of divination that's well suited to tell the future. Where tarot shines is in giving us new perspective on a situation or relationship and a way to connect to messages from your guides and the universe.

To phrase a question for tarot you'll want to keep your question open ended, focused on yourself and your feelings, and phrased positively.

# What to Expect from a Reading

When you book a reading with me you'll receive a photo of your tarot spread as well as a detailed pdf explaining the significance of each card in your reading.

Please note that readings are not a substitute for professional, qualified help. I am not an attorney, doctor or financial advisor. Therefore, I can't provide any legal, medical or financial advice.

I look forward to reading for you!
