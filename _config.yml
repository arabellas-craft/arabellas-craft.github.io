# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Tarot helps us navigate lifeâ€™s transitions with grace and compassion. It illuminates the unconscious, encourages self-reflection, and aids us in making informed choices. As your intuitive tarot reader, I will combine my intuition with my understanding of the tarot to see your core self, your struggles, and the most loving way for you to proceed.
